			\nHumans are not omniscient; if they can't see you, they can't hurt you. Master the art of staying unseen to gain the upper hand in combat. Move as slowly and carefully as possible, as sudden movements can easily give away your position. Utilize silenced weapons to eliminate targets without drawing attention, and take advantage of the cover of night or the sound-muffling effects of rain to move undetected.\n

            \nAgainst human enemies, effective camouflage can significantly increase their reaction time, giving you a critical window to act before they respond.\n

			\nMutants, on the other hand, rely heavily on their other senses. Armor camouflage may be less effective when facing these creatures.\n

			\nSome armor is more effective than others for blending into your surroundings. Choose your gear wisely to match your stealth tactics. Camouflage patterns and darker shades can help you remain unnoticed in various environments, from dense forests to urban ruins. Remember, the right armor not only protects you but also enhances your ability to stay hidden, making it harder for human enemies to react swiftly.\n

			\nAdditionally, certain helmets can further boost your stealth capabilities by reflecting less light and incorporating color patterns favorable for stealth gameplay. To maximize your ability to stay concealed, opt for smaller backpacks that reduce your overall profile and help you blend in more effectively. Every piece of equipment matters when you're trying to remain unseen.\n
