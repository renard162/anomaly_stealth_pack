			%c[pda_green]Craftable Basic Toolkit%c[ui_gray_1]\n \n
			\nWelcome to the Craftable Basic Toolkit mod. This article will outline the recipe for crafting a Basic Toolkit within your inventory.\n \n
			The intention behind this system is to allow you to bypass unlucky RNG, and to craft your own toolkit with salvaged parts, or by purchasing the components outright. The cost of purchasing the components ought to be considerably higher than the value of the toolkit - you are trading money for convenience.\n \n
			
			Crafting a Basic Toolkit can be broken down into three general stages or tiers. Each of the crafts in a given tier must be completed before progressing to the following tier of craft.\n \n
			
			%c[pda_green]Tier I. Basic Crafts%c[ui_gray_1]\n
			\n• Metallic Scraps + Fasteners = Assorted Parts and Fasteners
			\n• Zviezda Glue + Tur Glue = Assorted Adhesives
			\n• Hoppe's No.9 Solvent + Dvojka Cleaning Solvent = Assorted Solvents
			\n• File + Multitool = Assorted Handtools\n \n
			
			%c[pda_green]Tier II. Intermediate Crafts%c[ui_gray_1]\n
			\n •Assorted Parts and Fasteners + Assorted Adhesives = Maintenance Components
			\n •Assorted Solvents + Assorted Handtools = Maintenance Tools\n \n

			%c[pda_green]Tier III. Final Craft%c[ui_gray_1]\n
			\n •Maintenance Components + Maintenance Tools = Basic Toolkit\n \n
