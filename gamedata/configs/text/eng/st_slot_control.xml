    <text>Life Support Module</text>
  </string>
  <string id="st_lsm_desc">
    <text>An outdated military-issue Life Support Module. For a short period of time following the Second Chernobyl Incident, the Ukrainian SSU invested in the development of a field-portable automatic doctor system to improve the effectiveness of their field personnel, especially in special situations where heavy unconventional resistance was expected, supply lines were difficult to maintain, and field hospitals were impractical to set up due to the inherent lethality of the Zone itself. These field doctor units were issued to several combat and exploration battalions, and while effective, they are quite unpopular amongst the standing armed forces. This unit consists of a primary doctor unit that is worn on the left hip, connected to an adjustable forearm cuff by two sterile rubber tubes and one electronic cable. When the doctor unit detects anomalies in blood pressure and heart rate, stabilizer agents and morphine are issued in appropriate quantities via quick-inject needles in the forearm cuff. The system is designed to be worn under standard combat fatigues and comes equipped with a speaker unit to alert the user. Morphine and stabilizer agent reservoirs are swappable via cartridges, but due to a lack of proper equipment most stalkers recycle stimpacks and other autoinjectors to refill their LSMs.\n \n

    <text>Modernized special-forces Life Support Module. Based on the original Life Support Module design, these advanced modules were designed using research and specimens gathered in the Zone. The field doctor reservoirs of painkillers and stabilizers have been expanded, and the addition of small artifact fragments provides a passive beneficial effect to the user. Small numbers of these Life Support Modules have been produced owing in part to the difficulty in sourcing the right manufacturing materials, but they are highly popular and sought after amongst Spetsnaz units and Ecologists, even though the pain of the forearm injector is arguably worse than before.\n \n
