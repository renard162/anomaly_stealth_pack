			%c[pda_green]Psy health%c[ui_gray_1]\n
			\nTo survive in exclusion zone, you'll need more than physical strength, you'll also need to fight to maintain your sanity.
            
            \n \nStressful situations like combats, emissions, stay in anomalous areas, thirsty, hunger, sleepiness or stay injured will reduce your psy health.
            
            \n \nLow psy health will cause hallucinations, reduce your perceptions, and, in extreme cases, kill you, then take care.
            
            \n \nTo restore your sanity, stay in safe areas like near a %c[pda_yellow]lit campfire%c[ui_gray_1], a player mounted %c[pda_yellow]camping tent%c[ui_gray_1] or %c[pda_yellow]areas controlled by allied factions%c[ui_gray_1], use drugs like %c[pda_yellow]tobacco%c[ui_gray_1], %c[pda_yellow]Psy-block%c[ui_gray_1] or %c[pda_yellow]027 R pills%c[ui_gray_1], play some %c[pda_yellow]music%c[ui_gray_1], or %c[pda_yellow]sleep%c[ui_gray_1].
            
            \n \nEven inside areas controlled by allied factions, if you are near a lit campfire, you will recover your sanity much faster.
            
            \n \nOutside the areas controlled by allied factions, you can mount a camping tent near a lit campfire to create a calming atmosphere to rest in.
