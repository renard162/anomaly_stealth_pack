			\nTo survive in exclusion zone, you'll need more than physical strength, you need to fight to maintain your sanity.
            
            \n \nStressful situations like combats, emissions, stay in anomalous areas, thirsty, hunger, sleepiness or stay injured will reduce your psy health.
            
            \n \nLow psy health will cause hallucinations, reduce your perceptions and, in extreme cases, can kill you, then, take care.
            
            \n \nTo restore your sanity, stay in safe areas like near lit campfire or areas controlled by allied factions, use drugs like tobacco, Psy-block or 027 R pills, play some music or sleep.
            
            \n \nEven inside areas controlled by allied factions, if you are near a lit campfire, you will recover your sanity much faster.
